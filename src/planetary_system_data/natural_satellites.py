# this sub-program covers step 17 ("Natural Satellites") from Zeigler, 2024 - "Architect of Worlds: Comprehensive World 
# Design for Interstellar Fiction" - starting from pg. 83

# "This step determines the number and placement of major satellites. We define a major satellite as a natural satellite 
# which is large enough to have formed a sphere under its own gravitation. A major satellite will be at least 200 kilometers 
# in radius if it is mostly made of ice, or at least 300 kilometers in radius if it is mostly stone."

# "In general, the rocky planets close to a star are unlikely to form major satellites during the process of planetary 
# accretion. A terrestrial planet which suffers a specific kind of massive impact event may form one major satellite, as 
# the planetary material scattered into orbit coalesces. Gas giant planets are likely to have several major satellites. 
# For example, planets with major satellites in our own system include Earth (1), Jupiter (4), Saturn (7), Uranus (5), and 
# Neptune (1)."

# "Many planets will also have moonlets, much smaller satellites that are often irregular in shape. Some moonlets may be 
# remnants of the process of planetary formation. Others are likely to be captured asteroids or comets. Even small objects 
# may have moonlets of their own. In our system, the planet Mars has two moonlets, and many asteroids and Kuiper Belt objects 
# have been found to have moonlets of their own. A gas giant planet will often have dozens or even hundreds of moonlets in a 
# wide variety of orbits."

# Procedure

# "To determine the number and arrangement of natural satellites for a given planet, begin by computing the planet’s Hill 
# radius. This is the distance from the planet within which its gravitation dominates over that of the primary star. The Hill 
# radius defines the region of space where a satellite is likely to form or be captured, and where it can maintain a stable 
# orbit around the planet for long periods of time"

# "Compute the planet’s Hill radius using:"

# Codify equation on page 84

# "H is the Hill radius in kilometers, R<sub>min</sub> is the minimum distance from the planet to the primary star (in AUs), 
# M<sub>P</sub> is the mass of the planet (in Earth-masses), and M<sub>S</sub> is the mass of the primary star 
# (in solar masses). Round off to three significant figures."

# First Case: Satellites Forming via Natural Accretion

# "To estimate how many major satellites will form with the planet, as part of the original accretion process, evaluate the 
# following formula:"

# Codify Equation on Page 84

# "H is the Hill radius in kilometers, and R is the average distance from the planet to its primary star in AU. Round N down 
# to the next integer. If the result is greater than 0, then the planet will have one or more major satellites that formed 
# with the planet itself. No planet is likely to have more than about 8 major satellites."

# "If N is greater than 0, feel free to adjust it upward or downward by up to 2, so long as the result is still greater than 
# 0 and no greater than 8. To make this adjustment at random, roll 1d6: subtract 2 from N (minimum 1) on a result of 1, 
# subtract 1 from N (minimum 1) on a result of 2, add 1 to N (maximum 8) on a result of 5, and add 2 to N (maximum 8) on a 
# result of 6.

# "The innermost major satellite will have an orbital radius equal to about 1d+2 times the radius of the planet. Vary this 
# result by up to 10%."

# "Major satellites after the innermost can be placed using the Major Satellite Orbital Ratio Table. For each major satellite 
# proceeding outward, make a roll on the table and multiply the previous orbital radius by the indicated ratio. If a result 
# on the table does not yield an orbital resonance, feel free to select any value for the ratio between the next lower and next 
# higher entries. If a result on the table does yield an orbital resonance, apply exactly that ratio between satellite orbits. 
# As when placing planets, 2:1 Laplace resonances must occur in stacks of at least two. If this is not possible, adjust the 
# last ratio to be exactly 1.60."

# Codify Major Satellite Orbital Ratio Table

# "The eccentricity of major satellite orbits will be small (less than 0.01)."

# "The total mass of all major satellites formed during planetary accretion will be about one ten-thousandth of the mass of the 
# planet. The mass of each major satellite can be generated at random with a 3d6 roll"

# Codify Equation of page 85

# "M<sub>s</sub> is the mass of a major satellite in Earth-masses, M<sub>p</sub> is the mass of the planet in Earth- masses, 
# and N is the number of major satellites. Round the satellite’s mass off to two significant figures."

# "To determine the density of any of these major satellites, begin by determining whether the satellite will be rocky or icy. 
# A satellite will be rocky if its primary planet orbits inside the formation ice line, or it orbits a gas giant with a mass of 
# at least 200 Earth-masses, and the satellite’s orbital radius around the gas giant is no more than 600,000 km. Otherwise, the 
# satellite will be icy. Make a note of the satellite’s rocky or icy status for possible use in later steps of the design 
# sequence."

# "Next, apply the following:"

# Codify Equation of page 85

# "D is the satellite’s estimated density, and M is its mass in Earth-masses. Round the estimated density off to the nearest 
# hundredth. To determine the exact density, roll 3d6+10 (for a rocky satellite) or 3d6-20 (for an icy satellite). Multiply the 
# result by 0.01, and add to the estimated density to determine the actual density. A satellite’s density can be no less than 
# 0.18 or greater than 1.43. If necessary, adjust its density to be within this range."

# "As with a planet, compute a satellite’s radius using:"

# Codify Equation of page 85

# "R is the satellite’s radius in kilometers, M is its mass in Earth-masses, and D is its density. Round off to three 
# significant figures."

# "Use the following to compute a satellite’s surface gravity:"

# Codify Equation on page 85

# "G is the satellite’s surface gravity in standard g, M is its mass in Earth-masses, and D is itsbdensity. Round to the 
# nearest hundredth of a gravity."
 
# "If a planet has one or more major satellites formed during planetary accretion, it may also have many moonlets. We will not 
# generate these in detail, but they may be of interest in general. Close to the planet will be a family of inner moonlets. 
# These can range in number from a handful up to dozens. Their orbital radii range from about 1.8 times the planet’s radius, 
# out to just inside the radius of the innermost major satellite. In some cases, inner moonlets can be interspersed between the 
# orbits of the first few major satellites as well."

# "If there are inner moonlets, the planet is also likely to have a ring system. A few inner moonlets mean a thin system of 
# rings, not easily visible from any distance. More inner moonlets imply a thicker and more visible set of rings. Ring systems 
# hug close to the planet, reaching out to about twice the planet’s radius."

# "To generate the ring system at random, roll 3d6. On a result of 6-9, the planet will have a thin, wispy ring system 
# comparable to that of Jupiter or Neptune, barely visible even at close range. On a result of 10-13, the ring system will be 
# moderate, comparable to that of Uranus, visible from a distance through a telescope. On a result of 14 or higher, the planet 
# will have many inner moonlets, supporting a dense ring system comparable to Saturn’s, easily visible from anywhere in the 
# star system through a telescope, and spectacular at close range."

# "Beyond the major satellites will be one or more families of outer moonlets. As with the inner moonlets, these can range in 
# number from a handful up to dozens. They are captured planetoids or other debris, following orbits that are eccentric, 
# strongly inclined to the planet’s equator, or even retrograde. Their orbital radii begin at over 100 times the planet’s 
# radius and continue outward to about one-fifth to one-third of the planet’s Hill radius"

# Second Case: Satellites Forming via Major Impact

# "Leftover oligarchs and terrestrial planets, late in their formation process, are subject to repeated massive impact events. 
# The planetary material scattered into orbit by such impacts will, in some cases, form a large natural satellite. However, 
# that satellite is in turn likely to spiral back into collision with the parent planet, or to migrate outward and escape the 
# planet’s Hill radius entirely. In our own planetary system, only Earth still has a major satellite because of this process. 
# While Mercury, Venus, and Mars all appear to have suffered similar massive impacts, none of them have retained any resulting 
# major satellite."

# "To determine whether a leftover oligarch or terrestrial planet can have a large natural satellite, divide the planet’s Hill 
# radius by its own radius. If the result is 300 or greater, then the planet can retain a large natural satellite over the long 
# term. In this case, roll 1d: on a 5 or 6 the planet will have exactly one large natural satellite."

# "If it exists, the major satellite will form quite close to the planet but will quickly move outward due to tidal 
# interactions. Its current orbital radius will be between 40 and 100 times the planet’s radius. To generate an orbital radius 
# at random, roll 3d6+7 and multiply by 4 times the planet’s radius. The eccentricity of the major satellite’s orbit will be 
# small (no more than about 0.05)."

# "The major satellite formed by a massive impact event will have a mass about one hundredth of the mass of the planet. The 
# mass of the major satellite can be generated at random with a 3d6 roll:"

# Codity Equation on Page 86

# "M<sub>S</sub> is the mass of the major satellite, and M<sub>P</sub> is the mass of the planet, both in Earth-masses. Round 
# the satellite’s mass off to two significant figures."

# "To determine the density, radius, and surface gravity of the major satellite, apply the procedures from the First Case 
# above. Satellites of leftover oligarchs or terrestrial planets will almost certainly be rocky."

# Third Case: Terrestrial Planet Moonlets

# "If a leftover oligarch or terrestrial planet has no major satellite, it may acquire one or more moonlets through a variety 
# of means. For example, in our own planetary system, Mars has two moonlets."

# "A leftover oligarch or terrestrial planet may have moonlets if it can have a major satellite (that is, its Hill radius is at 
# least 300 times the planet’s own radius) but it has no such satellite. In this case, roll 1d: on a 4-6 the planet will have 
# at least one moonlet. Roll 1d-3 (minimum 1) for the number of moonlets"

# "The innermost moonlet will have an orbital radius equal to about 1d+2 times the radius of the planet (feel free to adjust 
# this by up to half the planet’s radius). Moonlets after the first can be placed using the Major Satellite Orbital Ratio Table 
# under the First Case above. The eccentricity of moonlet orbits will be very small (less than 0.02)."
