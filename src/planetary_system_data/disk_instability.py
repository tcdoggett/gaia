# this sub-program covers step 10 ("Disk Instability") from Zeigler, 2024 - "Architect of Worlds: Comprehensive World Design 
# for Interstellar Fiction"

# "Very early in the process of planetary formation, the first gas giant planets may form due to disk instability in the 
# protoplanetary disk. Here, the outer protoplanetary disk is perturbed by the gravitation of nearby stars, or due to the 
# formation of large clumps of material by random chance. The disk then forms spiral-arm structures, which can quickly give 
# rise to unusually massive gas giant planets. Disk instability is more likely to occur if the protoplanetary disk is denser
# (that is, if its disk mass factor, determined in Step Nine, is high)."

# "To determine at random whether disk instability took place, roll 3d6 and add the disk mass modifier determined in Step Nine. 
# If the result is 12 or higher, one or more planets may form due to disk instability. Otherwise, skip forward to Step Eleven."
